Thanks for stopping by and Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re here. This is where I keep track of all the stuff happening in my lifeâ€”whether it's celebrating new milestones, sharing my thoughts and knowledge through my blog and vlog, or mentioning the professional projects that keep me busy. You will also find a glimpse of my interests (which helps me break the monotony) and my career journey so far. Take a look around; I won't consider it stalking ðŸ‘€ and am always up to something interesting!
